## Testing on top of Komodo
fmo-sumo-uploader and [sim2sumo](https://github.com/equinor/fmu-sumo-sim2sumo) are both installed under `fmu/sumo/`.
This means that sim2sumo must also be installed to test a new version of the uploader on top of Komodo.

Example: Installing the uploader from `mybranch` on top of Komodo bleeding
```
< Create a new komodo env from komodo bleeding >
< Activate the new env >

pip install git+https://github.com/equinor/fmu-sumo-uploader.git@mybranch
pip install git+https://github.com/equinor/fmu-sumo-sim2sumo.git
```

The [Explorer](https://github.com/equinor/fmu-sumo) is also installed under `fmu/sumo`. Meaning that if the testing scenario includes the Explorer then it should also be installed on top of Komodo.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/equinor/fmu-sumo.git
```
